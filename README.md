# Student Performance Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the factors that affect student performance and building machine learning models to **predict exam scores**.  
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the training and evaluation of multiple regression models.

The models used include:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**


## Objectives
- Identify key factors influencing student performance.  
- Build and compare multiple regression models.  
- Evaluate models using performance metrics like **RÂ²**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**.  


## Dataset
**File:** `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`
